The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue x than to have the opinion on x of a person chosen randomly. You can read more about collaborative filtering [here][collab2].\n",

At first, people rate different items (like videos, images, games). After that, the system is making predictions about a user's rating for an item, which the user has not rated yet. These predictions are built upon the existing ratings of other users, who have similar ratings with the active user. For instance, in the image below the system has made a prediction, that the active user will not like the video.\n",

For each user, we have ratings for only a subset of the movies.

Then, it holds the movies matrix constrant and optimizes the value of the user's matrix.  This alternation between which matrix to optimize is the reason for the \"alternating\" in the name.\n",
